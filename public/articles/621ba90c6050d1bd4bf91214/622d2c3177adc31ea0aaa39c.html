<p>In this example, everything under the hood is in its expected and designated location. Even</p>
<p>though cars vary in many ways, their underlying functionality is the same, and so it makes</p>
<p>sense that the layout and design are familiar to the mechanic.</p>
<p>When we think about it, software is not so dissimilar. Most software we end up creating is</p>
<p>similar to other software in many ways. Most web applications, for example, will have a</p>
<p>way for users to register, to login, and change their name. Most software, regardless of the</p>
<p>problem domain, will have the concept of creation, read, update, and delete (CRUD).</p>
<p>These make up the famous verbs of persistent storage. Most software can be thought of as</p>
<p>fancy middleware sitting atop persistent storage. So, even though we may consider all</p>
<p>software applications to be quite different, their fundamentals are usually very similar. It</p>
<p>should, therefore, not be so difficult for us to write code that caters to the mechanic who</p>
<p>opens the hood.</p>
