<p>What is the focus of your work these days?</p>
<p>I'm working on the next step for microfrontends. It's been quite a time researching this topic, and especially now they are looking into a client side rendering microfrontend as well as server side rendering microfrontend with serverless. Those are the two main topics that I've been researching in the last few months, and I think we'll invest even more time during this year.</p>

<p>What is the motivation for your talk?</p>
<p>I believe microfrontends are getting a lot of traction. Every week I engage with new customers looking into starting their journey or reviewing what they have done so far with microfrontends, and I realize that there are common problems that they are facing every day. Considering my experience, that is found across the last seven years working with this architectural pattern, focusing my effort on where there is undifferentiated heavy lifting is and trying to provide a solution that will speed up the adoption of these architectural patterns is a good investment of my time.</p>
