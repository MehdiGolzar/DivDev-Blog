<p>To make the mechanic's work as simple as possible, we need to focus foremost on the</p>
<p>familiarity of our code. It's not simple to do this because different things are familiar to</p>
<p>different people, but, on the whole, we can take heed from the following guides:</p>
<p>Don't stray too far from common design patterns</p>
<p>Be consistent with syntax and presentation</p>
<p>Lend clarity to unfamiliar problem domains</p>
<p>The last point alludes to unfamiliar problem domains. This is something that you, as the</p>
<p>programmer, will have to think about when it comes to each code base you work on. To</p>
<p>discern if something can be considered unfamiliar, you can ask yourself: Would another</p>
<p>programmer working within another industry be able to understand this with little introduction?</p>
