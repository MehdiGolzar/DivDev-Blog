What happens now is that you need to script client side behavior on your end. This means the AJAX request will pass a 302 and other data that comes along for the ride to the callback on JS. No client side behavior can be altered from the server. It is up to you to do something with the AJAX returned values. If 500, throw an error message, 200 do something etc.
